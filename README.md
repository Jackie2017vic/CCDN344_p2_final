<!-- Readme -->
For the final version, I've developed from the last version but I updated the last 3 years data set to my model to see my activities on Twitter. I summaried all kinds of activies into 6 categories as: Tweet, Retweet, comments, like, following and follower. The viewers can see my most frequent activities on Twitter. I was thinking it's been a long way for this project. I'd like to make a data visulisation system with repetition and interaction and I'm thinking I almost get there.


<!-- *Feature* -->
* Ticking 'index' will show the categories of the data set
* Mouse hovering on different spots, it will display activity index in the middle of circle.
* The whole thing shows my activities on Twitter by distinguishing colors.
